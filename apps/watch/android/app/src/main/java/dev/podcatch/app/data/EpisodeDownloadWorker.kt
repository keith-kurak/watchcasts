/**
 * Downloads undownloaded episodes one at a time, sequentially.
 * Enqueued as unique work ("episode-downloads") with KEEP policy so only
 * one instance runs at a time. Loops until all episodes are downloaded.
 *
 * Runs as a long-running worker: [doWork] promotes itself with [setForeground] so it
 * is not subject to the ~10 minute job execution limit. Without that, a slow download
 * is killed mid-file and — with no resume — restarts at byte 0 forever.
 *
 * Partial downloads live in `<guid>.mp3.tmp` and are resumed with a `Range` header.
 * Only a fully downloaded file is renamed to `<guid>.mp3`.
 *
 * All traffic goes over a network acquired through [HighBandwidthNetwork]. Wear OS otherwise
 * proxies it over the Bluetooth link to the phone, which is slow enough to make a full
 * episode take hours.
