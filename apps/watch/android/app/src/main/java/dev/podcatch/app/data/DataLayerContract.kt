 * Kotlin mirror of packages/shared/src/datalayer.ts.

 * The phone app (TypeScript) and this watch app (Kotlin) cannot share code, so this
 * contract is duplicated by hand — in THREE places. The third is the phone's native
 * bridge:
 *     apps/mobile/modules/wear-data-layer/android/.../WearDataLayerModule.kt
 *
 * ANY change must be made in all three, or phone <-> watch sync breaks silently.
